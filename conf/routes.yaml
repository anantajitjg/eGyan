# HTTP routes configured on the Gateway
# -------------------------------------
# This section lets you define the mapping between HTTP(S) routes on your domain(s) ond
# the microservices running on your cluster
#
# The standard convention is to expose a microservice on a subdomain. The
# default services (data, auth, filestore, notify etc.) on the platform are
# exposed on their respective subdomains.
#
# Syntax
# ------
# The configuration syntax is fairly simple. It is a simple map, where the keys
# are subdomains, while the values are the corsesponding subdomain configuration
#
# So, the structure of this file looks like this:
#
# subdomain1: subdomain1 configuration
# subdomain2: subdomain2 configuration
# .
# .
# subdomainn: subdomainn configuration
#
# > Subdomain's Configuration
#   -----------------------
#   Each subdomain's configuration is again a map. This time the keys are
#   location (path) prefixes and the values are the corresponding location
#   configuration. This lets you define the action that the gateway needs
#   to take when the location is matched.
#
#   Expanding the above conf structure, we get
#
#   subdomain1:
#     location1: location configuration
#     location2: location configuration
#     .
#     .
#     locationn: location configuration
#
#   A location/path is the part of the url after the domain. For example:
#   In https://data.hello99.hasura-app.io/v1/query, /v1/query is the path
#
#   Example 1:
#
#   data:
#     /:
#       upstreamService:
#         name: data
#         namespace: {{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.hasura }}
#       upstreamServicePath: /
#       upstreamServicePort: 80
#
#   Here, we are configuring the gateway to send any request on data
#   subdomain to the 'data' microservice in the hasura  namespace if
#   the location has a prefix '/'. Since every location starts with
#   '/', this means that any request arriving on the data subdomain
#   is received by the data microservice.
#
#   Example 2:
#
#   api:
#     /shipping:
#       upstreamService:
#         name: shipping
#         namespace: {{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.user }}
#       upstreamServicePath: /
#       upstreamServicePort: 80
#     /recommed:
#       upstreamService:
#         name: recommend
#         namespace: {{ cluster.metadata.namespaces.user }}
#       upstreamServicePath: /
#       upstreamServicePort: 80
#
#   Here, anything on api.hello99.hasura-app.io/shipping/* -> shipping/
#                     api.hello99.hasura-app.io/recommend/* -> recommend/
#
#   NOTE:
#   1. Since the convention is to deploy a microservice on each domain, you'll rarely
#      see a configuration which has a location prefix other than '/'
#   2. If in case the location matches to more than one rule, the configuration
#      related to the more specific rule is used
#
# > Location Configuration
#   ----------------------
#   The following options are available:
#   key                  required            default
#   ------------------------------------------------
#   upstreamService      Yes                 -
#   upstreamServicePort  Yes                 -
#   upstreamServicePath  Yes                 -
#   enableAuth           No                  true
#   restrictToRoles      No                  null
#   corsPolicy           No                  []
#   enableWebsockets     No                  true
#   locationDirectives   No                  ""
#
#   - upstreamService:
#       The service to forward the request to
#   - upstreamServicePort:
#       The port on which the service is running
#   - upstreamServicePath:
#       The path to which the request has to be forwarded
#   - enableAuth:
#       This enables the session middlaware on the gateway to  intercept the
#       request and resolve the user's session based on Authorization header
#       or the Cookie
#   - restrictToRoles:
#       When the session middleware is enabled, restricts the matched URLs to
#       be only accessed by users which have at least one of these roles. This
#       is usually used to restrict access to admin only services like adminer etc.
#   - corsPolicy:
#       Can take the following 3 values:
#       1. "allow_all": Cross origin requests from any domain are allowed
#          Eg. corsPolicy: allow_all
#       2. "upstream" : The upstream service should handle CORS requests.
#          Eg. corsPolicy: upstream
#       3. Array of allowed origins: This allows the listed origins along
#          with all the subdomains on the current domain to make CORS requests.
#   - enableWebsockets:
#       Whether to allow websockets
#   - locationDirectives:
#       (Advanced) Additional nginx directives that need to go into the
#       location block
